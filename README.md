Peculiarity
===========

    pe·cu·li·ar·i·ty (p-ky l-r-t, -ky l-y r-) n. pl. pe·cu·li·ar·i·ties. 
      1. The quality or state of being peculiar.
      2. A notable or distinctive feature or characteristic.

Eventually I'd like to have an explanation here about what it means for Peculiarity to be an open source startup. For now, consider it this way: the code is open source, but I'm still launching the web app as a free service that you can use.
